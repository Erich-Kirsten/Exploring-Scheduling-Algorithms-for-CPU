# Exploring-Scheduling-Algorithms-for-CPU
The purpose of this  is to deepen my understanding of CPU scheduling by implementing and simulating five different scheduling algorithms. I simulate process generation, apply scheduling algorithms, and measure performance using both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling techniques.
